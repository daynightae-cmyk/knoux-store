/**
 * What this deployment is, and who may read it.
 *
 * Two facts, one module, and no imports — which is the point. Both were
 * previously spread across five route files, and they drifted:
 *
 *   - the environment. `project` derived it from `VERCEL_ENV` while `file`,
 *     `git`, `providers` and `verify` hard-coded `production`. The same adapter
 *     then reported a different environment depending on which route asked, and
 *     the interface could show a checkout as production on one panel and local
 *     on the next. A hard-coded value is not a derived one.
 *
 *   - who may read the workspace. It was nobody's business but the route
 *     handler's, so it was nobody's decision.
 *
 * The environment is derived exactly once, and never from a request body, a
 * query parameter or a header. A caller must not be able to ask "is this local
 * mode?" and get an answer that changes what the adapter will do.
 *
 * Zero imports, deliberately. A policy that cannot be loaded without a
 * framework, a bundler alias or a request context in scope cannot be tested by
 * running it — and the previous redirect guard is exactly the failure that
 * assumption produces.

 * The workspace reads the deployment's own checkout: a file inventory, Git

 * is a secret in the cryptographic sense — the repository is public — but the
 * inventory of a running deployment is not a public document. It describes the
 * machine, and it cost real CPU and I/O to produce: one `/project` request
 * walks thousands of files and `/git` spawns a process.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   - `local`      a developer on their own machine, reading their own checkout.
 *                  Anonymous by design; there is no attacker to defend against,
 *                  and requiring a sign-in would break local work for nothing.
 *   - `preview` /
 *     `production` reachable over the internet. Requires a verified Supabase
 *                  session, server-side. Hiding the controls in the browser is
 *                  not a control: the route answers a bare `curl` regardless of
 *                  what the interface renders.
 *
 * A preview URL is treated as public on purpose. Preview deployments are
 * reachable by anyone holding the link, and "only a few people have it" is a
 * property of distribution, not of access control.
 *
 * `KNOUX_BUILD_PUBLIC=1` is the single documented opt-out, for a deployment
 * that is deliberately an anonymous demo. It is opt-in and exact; a near-miss
 * spelling does not count.
