/**
 * A fixed-window request counter.
 *
 * Kept in its own module because two boundaries need it — the KNOuX DEV
 * workspace reads and the public contact intake — and two copies of a limiter
 * is two places for the ceiling to drift.
 *
 * What this is, precisely: a per-process window. On a serverless platform each
 * instance keeps its own, so the effective ceiling is the per-instance limit
 * times the instance count. That is stated in the code rather than implied,
 * because the alternative — describing it as a rate limiter and leaving the
 * reader to assume a distributed guarantee — is how a control ends up believed
 * in and not present.
 *
 * What it is for: bounding how much work one caller can force per minute. A
 * per-process window does that. It is not an identity system and is not used
 * as one.
